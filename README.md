# My Personal Project: PuppyPal

## Description

**PuppyPal** is an application for dog owners to keep track of their dogs' health, daily routines, or growth progress. 
It's like a digital diary and manager for the dog's well-being. Users can add the profile or identity of their dogs 
with name, weight, height and breed. PuppyPal helps records health property of the dog that allows users to monitor 
their dog's progress in health and many other aspects. This project is interesting for me because I personally love 
dogs, and I have some. Therefore, as a dog owner, I think it will make life so much easier to have an app that keeps
track of all our dog's needs and to ensure that our dogs are happy and healthy.
