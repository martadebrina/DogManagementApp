# My Personal Project: PuppyPal

## Description

**PuppyPal** is an application for dog owners to keep track of their dogs' health, daily routines, or growth progress. 
It's like a digital diary and manager for the dog's well-being. Users can add the profile or identity of their dogs 
with name, weight, height and breed.
PuppyPal helps schedule feeding, log and remember medications, vaccinations, de-wormings and hygiene, and record 
important vet visits. PuppyPal allows users to monitor their dog's progress in health and many other aspects. 
This project is interesting for me because I personally love dogs, and I have some. 
Therefore, as a dog owner, I think it will make life so much easier to have an app that keeps track of 
all our dog's needs and to ensure that our furry friends are happy and healthy.
